To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you\u2019ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients' homes.\n\n### Project Files\nFor this assignment, you can find the `boston_housing` folder containing the necessary project files on the [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!\n\n### Evaluation\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href=\"https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/103/view\" target=\"_blank\">Predicting Boston Housing Prices project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.\n\n### Submission Files\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, you may supply the following files on your GitHub Repo in a folder named `boston_housing` for ease of access:\n - The `boston_housing.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.\n - An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.\n\n### I'm Ready!\nWhen you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href=\"http://discussions.udacity.com\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forums</a>.\n\n### What's Next?\nYou will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!", "nomination_eligible": false}}
