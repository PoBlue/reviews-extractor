Students will be using Unity 5.6.1 patch 2, which you will need to grade them. \n\nThe goal is to customize the **Udacity Carnival** project, which will be something cool that they can show off to their friends and family! The Udacity Carnival consists of 3 Mini-Games: Plinko, Wheel of Fortune, and Coin Toss. With each game, you earn points. When you earn 2000 points, you will receive a virtual classic Carnival prize! Currently in the starter project, the games are broken and it is up to students to fix them. Please refer to [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/988/view) for tasks that students will be required to complete.\n\nThe primary purpose of this project is for students to learn how to deploy a Unity project onto their phone. As always make sure to give students as much feedback as possible, but you can be lenient when grading and this will be reflected in the reviewer tips for each rubric item. \n\n<center><img src=\"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/QcNZ_0sNJey1Qb35mMTLzfuG4t5T35_NffX6joQKvkaIOn-sMDSfO1FPBZVn2vvVvvbkRLLg2t7QMERUGYsJ=s0#w=444&h=348\" /></center>", "nomination_eligible": true}}
