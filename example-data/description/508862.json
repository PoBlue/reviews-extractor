Students will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers. \n\n## How will students complete this project? \n1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) \n2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer. \n3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list. \n4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud036/fresh_tomatoes.py). This module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.\n5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.\n\n## Project Display Example\n **Note: The screenshots on this page are just examples of one implementation of the minimal functionality. You are encouraged to redesign and strive for even better solutions.** The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers: \n![Movie Trailer Home](https://i.imgur.com/StTWsH9.png) \n\n## Simple home page where movies are laid out \n\n![Movie Trailer](https://i.imgur.com/18cp1qa.png) \n\n## Page allows users to click on a movie image to watch its trailer\n", "nomination_eligible": false}}
