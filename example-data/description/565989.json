Now for the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for... time to get feedback from a Udacity Reviewer and see how you did! Let\u2019s just go through a few quick checks to make sure all our i's are dotted and t's are crossed.\n\n## Check Your Submission Against the Rubric\nWe will use [this rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/187/view) to evaluate your project. Take a quick minute to make sure you\u2019ve covered each item in your submission. Try to feel that your project meets specifications on all rubric points before you submit your work.\n\nRemember that this project is meant to provide you with a quick opportunity to experience the submission process and feedback for your learning. You\u2019re not required to meet specifications on this project, although you are welcome to resubmit until you meet specifications if you like.\n\n## Submit Your Project for Review\n\nTo get your project prepared for submission, it is recommended that you save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n\nFor this particular project, you only need to submit the completed report; you do not need to submit the supplemental scripts or data files. When you\u2019re ready, click the \u201cSubmit Project\u201d button below!\n\n## What Next?\nThere\u2019s no need to stall your learning while you wait for feedback. You can continue on your learning journey with the next module: Statistics!", "nomination_eligible": false}}
