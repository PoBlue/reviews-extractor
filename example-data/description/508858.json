The important components are that the script should be in a 3 column spreadsheet format - with a primary storyline in column A, a secondary storyline in column B, and any other action listed in the third column C. Rows in the column indicate simultaneous time. The storyboard should clearly communicate how the scene is set up, and should give you enough information along with the script that theoretically you could shoot this 360 story.  \n\nStandout projects are the ones which tell a good story - telling a great story is not required for this project to meet requirements,. it's possible for a project to meet specifications without telling a good story. Standout projects are the ones which you think would be interesting to view in 360, finished film form.\n\n", "nomination_eligible": true}}
