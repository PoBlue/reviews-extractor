You\u2019ll be training a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.\n\n### Getting the project files\nThe project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/), in the `language-translation` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer\nThis way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.\n\n### Submission\n1.
