Now you'll work on your own to practice your skills and demonstrate what you've learned.\r\n\r\nFor this project, you'll be building **Reverse** Mad-Libs. You play Reverse Mad-Libs by reading a sentence with blanks in it and then filling in the blanks appropriately. This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.\r\n\r\nOnce you've created the game according to the rubric specification below you should submit your python file (named `reverse-mad-libs.py`). Your project reviewer will review and provide feedback on two aspects of your submission: the game itself and the Python code you've written.\r\n\r\n### 1 - Game Review\r\nIn this portion of the review, your reviewer will be checking to make sure the game works the way it's supposed to. See the rubric below for exact specs.\r\n\r\n### 2 - Code Review\r\nYour reviewer will also look at the Python code you've written and provide feedback on:\r\n\r\n* **Use of Variables**: Your code should take advantage of variables and variable **names** should reflect the **values** they store. \r\n\r\n* **Functions**: Your code should use functions appropriately to avoid repetition. Function parameters should have logical names and should all be used in the body of the function.\r\n\r\n* **Appropriate use of Data**: Data types (`strings` vs `lists` for example) should be used appropriately. \r\n\r\n* **Appropriate use of other coding techniques**: Your code should use statements like `if`, `then`, `else`, `while`, etc... appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe rubric that will be used is included below:\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ymgkyG8.png)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/NbniH3W.png)", "nomination_eligible": false}}
