Your network architecture could benefit from some improvements, including the addition of more layers and using smaller initialization values of the weights. But the main thing is that you've done most of the work already in this project. You did a very good job in setting up the network structure and implementing the training mechanism. The steps you now need to take won't take much time and can be very fulfilling as you'll transform your object recognizer from an already good one into something great.

The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.  The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.  You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer.  At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images. \n\n### Getting the project files\nThe project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the `image-classification` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer\n\nThis way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`. Please note this project is written in Python 3.x.\n\n### Submission\n1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.\n2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/723/view).\n3. When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing \"Download as\" > HTML. ** Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together. **\n4. Package the \"dlnd_image_classification.ipynb\", \"helper.py\", \"problem_unittests.py\", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.\n5. Hit Submit Project below!
