After nearly 32,000 letters sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly *15 million* working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent. \n\n### Project Files\nFor this assignment, you can find the `finding_donors` folder containing the necessary project files on the [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!\n\n### Evaluation\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the **<a href=\"https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/406/view\" target=\"_blank\">Finding Donors for CharityML project rubric</a>**. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be *meeting specifications* for you to pass.\n\n### Submission Files\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload. Alternatively, you may supply the following files on your GitHub Repo in a folder named `finding_donors` for ease of access:\n - The `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file with all questions answered and all code cells executed and displaying output.\n - An **HTML** export of the project notebook with the name **report.html**. This file *must* be present for your project to be evaluated.\n\n### I'm Ready!\nWhen you're ready to submit your project, click on the **Submit Project** button at the bottom of the page.\n\nIf you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at **machine-support@udacity.com** or visit us in the <a href=\"http://discussions.udacity.com\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forums</a>.\n\n### What's Next?\nYou will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you. In the meantime, review your next project and feel free to get started on it or the courses supporting it!", "nomination_eligible": false}}
