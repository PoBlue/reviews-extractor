Here are two you should consider.\n\nSCQA, also called the Pyramid Principle and the Pixar framework\n\n**SCQA**: One framework you can use to create an engaging story is called SCQA which stands for situation, complication, question, and answer.\n\nThe situation is a clear, crisp statement of the facts. It's the state of affairs as they are right now. \nComplication is the thing that's changed that makes things harder; the change in circumstances that you should be concerned about.\nQuestion normally falls out of the situation and complication. Like, what should we do?\nAnd Answer is the answer to this question - it usually resolves the complication.\n\n**SCQA Example:**\nHere\u2019s how SCQA would apply to the story of Little Red Riding Hood. \nSituation:  Little red riding hood walks through the woods to deliver food to her grandmother\nComplication: A wolf pretends to be her grandmother so that he can eat Little Red Riding Hood\nQuestion: How will she escape?\nAnswer: A lumberjack comes to the rescue\n\n**Pixar**: The Pixar framework is from Pixar, a famous storytelling company responsible for some of the most popular animated movies of all time like Toy Story. Pixar\u2019s stories follow this simple outline.\n\nOnce there was a - usually a protagonist with a goal\nEveryday - describes the protagonist\u2019s routine\nUntil one day  - something pivotal that changes everything\nBecause of that- what follows as a result\nBecause of that\nUntil then - the protagonist reaches goal, but often not in the way they  originally thought they would \nEver since then - how the character and their situation has changed.\n\n**Pixar Example**\nHere\u2019s how the Pixar framework would apply to Star Wars.\n\nOnce there was a farm boy who wanted to be a fighter pilot\nEveryday he helped out on the farm\nUntil one day his family is killed\nBecause of that he joins Obi-wan kenobi\nBecause of that there were lots of wars in stars.\nUntil finally he becomes a star fighter pilot and saves the day\nEver since then he\u2019s known not only as a pilot but also a Jedi\n\n\n**Social Media Landscape and categories:**\n\nMuch of the social media landscape falls into 6 main categories: Publishing, Sharing, Messaging, Discussing, Collaborating, and Networking. These categories describe how the respective social media channels are primarily used. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind as well when you choose your channel and create content to fit that channel.\nWhat about the most popular social media sites?  Many of these channels serve multiple purposes. \n\nFor example, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn allow for Publishing, Sharing, Messaging, Discussing, Collaborating, AND Networking.\nWhereas Pinterest and Instagram are more visual. But as they are mainly about photos, they are more static.\n\nYouTube is also visual but video is more dynamic.\n\nSnapchat takes visuals and the dynamics of video further by incorporating messaging.
