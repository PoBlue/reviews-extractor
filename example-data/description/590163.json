This is especially important for entry-level candidates, but also important to those with more experience, because it shows that person is still passionate about coding and has worked recently with new trends in development.\n\nGitHub Profiles are a key piece of \"evidence\" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate, because they can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub. In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n1.
