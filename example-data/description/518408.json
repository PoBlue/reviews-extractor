We'll be giving them some very light starter code but they'll be putting in the legwork with the algorithms. Their code will need to compile and come within 1% RMSE of the ground truth in order to pass. Once they get past that point, take a look at their algorithms and look for glaring inefficiencies. Their code doesn't need to extract the most of every single CPU cycle, but we expect that they do a reasonable job with practices like caching reusable values and avoiding unnecessary loops.\r\n\r\nYou can find a reviewer guide for this project [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t4RDYFI4kcOTwLtTP_YP0vS1iPVtnkyX3HIGTEntEO4/pub?embedded=true)", "nomination_eligible": true}}
