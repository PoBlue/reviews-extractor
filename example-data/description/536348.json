In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine\u2019s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  \n\nAlong with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!\n\n\n### Instructions for Completing the Project on Your Local Machine\n\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.\n\t\n\t```bash\t\n\tgit clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git; cd dog-project\n\t```\n2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.  \n3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder. \n4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.\n5. Install the necessary Python packages. \n\n\tFor __Mac/OSX__:\n\t```bash\n\tconda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml\n\tsource activate aind-dog\n\tKERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c \"from keras import backend\"\n\t```\n\n\tFor __Windows__:\n\t```bash\n\tconda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-windows.yml\n\tactivate aind-dog\n\tset KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow\n\tpython -c \"from keras import backend\"\n\t```\n6. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.\n\t\n\t```bash\n\tjupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb\n\t```\n\n__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__\n\n## Evaluation\n\nYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the CNN project [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/810/view).  Review this rubric thoroughly, and self-evaluate your project before submission.  All criteria found in the rubric must meet specifications for you to pass.\n\n\n## Project Submission\n\nWhen you are ready to submit your project, collect the following files and compress them into a single archive for upload:\n- The `dog_app.ipynb` file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.\n- An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name `report.html` or `report.pdf`.\n- Any additional images used for the project that were not supplied to you for the project. __Please do not include the project data sets in the `dogImages/` or `lfw/` folders.  Likewise, please do not include the `bottleneck_features/` folder.__\n\nAlternatively, your submission could consist of the GitHub link to your repository.\n\n### Ready to submit your project?\n\nClick on the \"Submit Project\" button and follow the instructions to submit!", "nomination_eligible": true}}
