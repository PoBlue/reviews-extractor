Job candidates use LinkedIn to 1) expand their own network, where they'd have access to more information and more people to collaborate with and 2) to advertise their job candidacy to recruiters.\n\n###Student Instructions \nLinkedIn has become the giant in professional networking, to the point where it may be a red flag if you *don't* have a LinkedIn profile. Use your LinkedIn to find connections and join groups, which are great ways to find opportunities. Most importantly, have opportunities *come to you* by optimizing your LinkedIn profile for recruiter searches!\n\n## Submission Instructions\n1. Follow LinkedIn's specific guidelines on completing your profile. This will help you use it effectively (ie: turn up in boolean search results, get relevant suggestions for jobs).\n2. Apply Udacity's LinkedIn guidelines, found under Project Resources below. These specifications were created with recruiter and LinkedIn experts' input.\n3. Make sure your LinkedIn profile is public by [checking your settings](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=nprofile-public-profile-settings-redirect).\n4. Create a custom public profile URL [on the same public profile edit page](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/settings?trk=nprofile-public-profile-settings-redirect).\n5. Submit that URL as your project.\n\n## Project Resources\n1. [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/51/view). *Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity Career Reviewer against this rubric.*\n2. [Project checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BZMxuKnBNovOyMelEx7d8ktbsWGj0EJ9KaD81dVC1TE/pub?embedded=true). *Based on the project rubric, this is a handy checklist to use during your LinkedIn building.*\n3. [Career Resource Center](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/linkedin-github-profiles). *Find additional tips and guides on developing your LinkedIn profile.*\n\n## Up Next\nAlthough LinkedIn is the primary networking profile you'll use, there are plenty more out there, such as on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (for data science), [AngelList](https://angel.co/), etc. Use what you've learned in this project and apply it throughout your online profiles!", "nomination_eligible": false}}
