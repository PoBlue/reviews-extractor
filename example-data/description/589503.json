When you are ready, save your file as a PDF and submit it here.\n\nThe submissions slide template includes three sections: \n1. Evaluate the display image campaign for DMND\n2. Evaluate the video ad campaign for DMND \n3. Provide recommendations for future campaigns\n\n### Part 1: Evaluate the Display Image Campaign for DMND\n1. Present the data and calculate the ROI of the Ad overall \n2. Evaluate which Ad performed best?\n3. Determine which Keywords performed best?\n4. Provide at least **three** suggestions on how you would optimize this ad campaign\n\n### Part 2: Evaluate the Video Ad Campaign for DMND \n1.

Provide at least **three** suggestions on how you would optimize this ad campaign\n\n### Part 3: Future Campaign Recommendations \nOnce you have completed your campaign evaluation, we ask you to outline what you would do if you had additional campaign budget. Again, feel free to use bullet points for your evaluation and structure it in any way that works for you. You can use as many slides as you want for your evaluation. We have prepared a few questions that you can use to structure your recommendations, but this serves only as a guide:\n\n1. Which digital channel or campaign performed best?\n2. Based on the results, which channel would you further invest in the future?\n3. What further optimization would you do to this ad campaign? (Ad creative, keywords, ad copy, landing pages, offers, etc\u2026)\n\n## Submission\nOnce you have completed all the slides, including the final section that contains your screenshot, be sure to convert your slides into a PDF and submit it below. \n\nIt's straightforward to convert a PowerPoint presentation into a pdf on a PC or Mac.
