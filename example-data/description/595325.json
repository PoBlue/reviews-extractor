This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacity\u2019s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.\n\nYour first step in predicting yearly sales is to first format and blend together data from different datasets and deal with outliers.\n\nYour manager has given you the following information to work with:\n\n1. The monthly sales data for all of the Pawdacity stores for the year 2010.\n2. NAICS data on the most current sales of all competitor stores where total sales is equal to 12 months of sales.\n3. A partially parsed data file that can be used for population numbers.\n4. Demographic data (Households with individuals under 18, Land Area, Population Density, and Total Families) for each city and county in the state of Wyoming. For people who are unfamiliar with the US city system, a state contains counties and counties contains one or more cities.\n\n<center> **Map of Wyoming Counties**</center>", "nomination_eligible": false}}
