Be sure to look through the notes you've taken to make sure you understand the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts you've learned throughout the course so far. \n\nAnd remember, you can make this project on *any* topic you'd like!\n\n### Code Review\nYour reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on each rubric item for the project. You can view the rubric [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3836128891/rubric).\n\n* **Use of Syntax**: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass [HTML validation](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) tests. \n\nWe recommend that you look over the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3836128891/rubric) to make sure your project meets requirements before submitting your project.\n\nIf you are feeling stuck on the project, please check out the discussions on our [student forums](https://forums.udacity.com).
