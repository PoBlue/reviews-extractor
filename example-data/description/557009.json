Also note that apart from validation loss, training time is also an important factor in deciding hyperparameters. \n\nAlso, next time write down your thoughts regarding model in \"Thinking about your results\" section.\nHere some questions to get a better understanding of your model:\n\nWhat do you think of the Christmas period?\nHow many times was this period on the training set?\nDo you think that the model can learn special features only by seeing an event one time?\n\nNice first attempt.

By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!\r\n\r\nThe data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).\r\n\r\n### Instructions \r\n\r\n1. Download the project materials from [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning). You can either download the repository with `git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git`, or download it as an archive file from [this link](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/archive/master.zip). Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.\r\n2. cd into the `dlnd-your-first-network` folder that you just unzipped.\r\n3. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the [Anaconda lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2a9dba0b-28eb-4b0e-acfa-bdcf35680d90/modules/aba54606-cf35-4a77-b643-efec6a90bfa1/lessons/9e9ed61d-20c3-4431-95aa-a1099f28d601/concepts/4cdc5a26-1e54-4a69-8eb4-f15e37aaab7b).\r\n4. Create a new conda environment:\r\n```bash\r\nconda create --name dlnd python=3\r\n```\r\n5. Enter your new environment:\r\n   * Mac/Linux: `>> source activate dlnd`\r\n   * Windows: `>> activate dlnd`\r\n6. Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` installed by doing the following:\r\n```bash\r\nconda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook\r\n```\r\n7. Run the following to open up the notebook:\r\n```bash\r\njupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb\r\n```\r\n.\r\n6. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.\r\n7. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!\r\n\r\nIf you need help running the notebook file, check out the [Jupyter notebook lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2a9dba0b-28eb-4b0e-acfa-bdcf35680d90/modules/aba54606-cf35-4a77-b643-efec6a90bfa1/lessons/13f4b7d6-92a9-468d-9008-084fc8b53a23/concepts/75e1eee0-5f81-4d5b-a1ca-eaebe3c91759).\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\n\r\nYou can expect to get feedback from your Udacity reviewer within 3-4 days.\r\n\r\n### Submission\r\n\r\n1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.\r\n2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/700/view).\r\n3. When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing \"Download as\" > HTML. ** Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together. **\r\n4. Package the notebook and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the notebook and the HTML file to a GitHub repo.\r\n5. Hit Submit Project below! \r\n\r\n### What to do afterwards\r\n\r\nIf you're waiting for new content or to get the review back, here's a [great video from Frank Chen](https://vimeo.com/170189199) about the history of deep learning. It's a 45 minute video, sort of a short documentary, starting in the 1950s and bringing us to the current boom in deep learning and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\n[![AI and Deep Learning](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd101/Screen+Shot+2017-01-27+at+11.38.54+AM.png)](https://vimeo.com/170189199)", "nomination_eligible": false}}
