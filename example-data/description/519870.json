This project builds on the techniques developed in the very first lane finding project, with the addition of techniques to track the position of the lane boundaries in complex conditions including curved lines, shadows, and pavement color changes.  In addition to the position of the lane lines in an image, students will report the curvature of the lines and the vehicle's position with respect to center in the lane. \n\nA detailed Reviewer's Guide [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18CzVGqQDHOcPQn6RaR66Dr24VIwbrHDsX4j8s9TWwvM/pub?embedded=true).\n\nThe project repo can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines\n\n", "nomination_eligible": true}}
