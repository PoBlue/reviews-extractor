Your understanding and clarity of concepts of how GANs work is vividly depicted here. You've done a great job of implementing a Deep Convolutional GAN.  \n\nYou've almost done the hard part of building the neural network, all it now needs is some subtle corrections (running the code after normalising the input image of D to the same range as the outputs of G) and some more hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning can sometimes be a very daunting task, but I have put forward my tips and suggestions which will help you in tuning up your GAN in no time at all and will get you pass this project with your next submission.\n\nMoreover, even you will be amazed by the results that shall be produced!\n\nI am confident that you will do great in your next submission. :smile:\nAnd Congratulations once again, as you're about to complete this Deep Learning Nanodegree.", "hidden": false, "previous_submission_id": null, "nomination": null, "language": "en-us", "rubric_id": 891, "is_training": false, "canary_metadata": null, "checkmate_metadata": null, "escalated_at": null, "ungradeable_tag": null, "project_id": 301, "user": {"name": "Shingo", "udacity_key": "3934758796"}, "grader": {"name": "Tushar", "udacity_key": "3763018746"}, "project": {"id": 301, "name": "Generate Faces"}, "rubric": {"description": "Students will use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.\n\nStudent Instructions:\n\n# Face Generation\n### Introduction\nIn this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.\n\n### Getting the project files\nThe project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/), in the `face_generation` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer\n\nThis way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.\n\n### Submission\n1. Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.\n2. Ensure you pass all points on [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/891/view).\n3. When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the **File** menu in the notebook and choosing \"Download as\" > HTML. ** Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together. **\n4. Package the \"dlnd_face_generation.ipynb\", \"helper.py\", \"problem_unittests.py\", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or push the files from your GitHub repo.\n5. Hit Submit Project below!
