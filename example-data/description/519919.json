However, students may use higher-level libraries such as Keras or TF Slim. Students will submit a Jupyter notebook with their TensorFlow models, as well as an HTML export of the model. They will also include a writeup report file.\r\n\r\nOne of the tasks for the project is to find other images online for which to use the classifier. Students will include those images with their submissions. For more detailed reviewer instructions, [see this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xj9yjlWP9MvRFhhRl27vKz6zhVFtHClWqc5HwtsC8g/pub?embedded=true).\r\n\r\n<h3>**Student Instructions**</h3> \r\n\r\n# Traffic Sign Classifier Project\r\n\r\nIn this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Specifically, you'll train a model to classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). \r\n\r\nAfter you train your model, you will test it on new images of German traffic signs you find on the web. Or, if you're feeling adventurous, test your model on pictures of traffic signs you find locally!\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n1. [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32.\r\n2. Clone the project and start the notebook.\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project\r\ncd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project\r\nconda env create -f environment.yml\r\nsource activate CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### TensorFlow\r\n\r\nIf you have access to a GPU, you should follow the TensorFlow instructions for [installing TensorFlow with GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#optional_install_cuda_gpus_on_linux).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can install the `tensorflow-gpu` package: \r\n\r\n`pip install tensorflow-gpu`\r\n\r\n#### Amazon Web Services\r\n\r\nInstead of a local GPU, you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance. (This costs money.)\r\n\r\n1. [Follow the Udacity instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/fbf77062-5703-404e-b60c-95b78b2f3f9e/modules/6df7ae49-c61c-4bb2-a23e-6527e69209ec/lessons/614d4728-0fad-4c9d-a6c3-23227aef8f66/concepts/f6fccba8-0009-4d05-9356-fae428b6efb4) to launch an EC2 GPU instance with the `udacity-carnd` AMI.\r\n2. Complete the **Setup** instructions.\r\n3. Install TensorFlow with GPU support. All of the necessary dependencies are pre-installed on the AMI, so you can jump straight to installing the package: \r\n`pip install tensorflow-gpu`\r\n\r\n## Start the Project\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb`\r\n2. Follow the instructions in the notebook\r\n3. Write your project report", "nomination_eligible": true}}
