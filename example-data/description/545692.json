The speed limit was greatly increased from the behavioral cloning project, 30mph to 100mph. There is NO REQUIREMENT on the speed the student can pass the track on. This is meant to be an extra fun part.\n\nWhat will they submit?\n\nThe student will submit a fork of the repo: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project.\n\nWhat should the reviewer have?\n\nAs the reviewer you have the appropriate version of the simulator and [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets), [CppAd](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/), and [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) installed.\n\n1. Clone/fork the project's template files from the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project). (Note: Please do not submit your project as a pull request against our repo!)\n2. Choose your state, input(s), dynamics, constraints and implement MPC.\n3. Test your solution on basic examples.\n4. Test your solution on the simulator! \n5. When the vehicle is able to drive successfully around the track, submit! ***Remember to include a separate file in .txt, .md, .html, or .pdf format addressing the questions in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/896/view).***\n6. Try to see how fast you get the vehicle to **SAFELY** go!", "nomination_eligible": true}}
