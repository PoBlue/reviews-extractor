Your color is attractive and your style is very interesting. It's very clean and comfortable to read.\n\n It would be better if you improve the indentation. You can see about it [here](http://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/formatting-and-indenting-your-html/#best-method-indent-textcontent-).\n\nOverall is awesome. Thank you for your submission and Keep up on your good works.

Similar HTML elements should have the same class names.\r\n\r\n### 2 - Content Review\r\nIn addition to looking at the code you write, your project reviewer will also read your notes to help ensure you have a good understanding of the most important concepts covered so far. They will be looking for:\r\n\r\n* **Understanding of Structured Documents**: Your notes should demonstrate an understanding of what it means for computer code to be \"structured.\"\r\n* **Learning Resources**: Your notes should include at least 1 link to programming resources (Udacity Forums, Stack Overflow, Mozilla Developer Network for example)\r\n* **Basic HTML and CSS knowledge**: Your project reviewer won't be looking for anything specific in this area, but will be providing general feedback about these two languages.\r\n\r\n", "nomination_eligible": true}}
