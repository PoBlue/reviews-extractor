For example:\n\n![1.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/3576/1494601839/1.png)\n\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n- 1) **INDENTING**\n**Indenting** your code makes it much more readable. This is a very important habit to have because it makes your code much more maintainable.\n_________________________\n\n- 2) **MULTIPLE LINES**\nWhen you have a piece of text longer than 79 characters it's considered good practice break this text in multiple lines.  For example:\n\n### Bad:\n![1.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/3576/1494605602/1.png)\n### Good:\n![Screenshot from 2017-05-12 10-10-00.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/3576/1494605420/Screenshot_from_2017-05-12_10-10-00.png)\n________________________\n- 3) **URL**\n**URLS** are an exception. Don't split a url over two lines because it makes the urls hard to read, the instead add the comment # NOQA\n(The comment # noqa lets you skip error in tools such asPEP 8 online,)\n\n![1.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/3576/1494606675/1.png)\n\n________________________________\n\n- 4) **PEP8**\nI recommend pass your code through the on-line tool [ PEP8 checker](http://pep8online.com/)\n\n### I hope you find the feedback useful :smile:", "position": 11, "created_at": "2017-06-21T02:46:11.783Z", "updated_at": "2017-06-21T02:46:11.783Z"}, {"category": "awesome", "content_id": 32117305, "id": 1825514, "user_id": 3576, "body": "Good work importing the modules.
