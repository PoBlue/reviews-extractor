You also need to provide instruction on setting up the news database. Provide explicit instructions, with the exact commands needed to create and setup the database. \n\nYou also ask the user to *\"cd to the vagrant machine*\". Since you don't mention Vagrant anywhere before this, this could be confusing for the reader. Perhaps in your installation section, you can ensure the user has the proper vagrant environment set up. You could provide a link to the udacity fullstack vagrant repository.\n\nTo make your instructions easier to read, I recommend using an ordered list. Use Markdown to style the lists. For example, the following:\n\n```\n1. Once all files are downloaded, cd to the vagrant directory that contains the project files.\n2.  From the command line, to power up the virtual machine,  run: `vagrant up`. \n3. Log into the virtual machine by typing: `vagrant ssh` \n4. cd to the logs folder and run the program by typing: `python logs.py`\n```\n\nThe above will render as:\n\n1. Once all files are downloaded, cd to the vagrant directory that contains the project files.\n2.  From the command line, to power up the virtual machine,  run: `vagrant up`. \n3. Log into the virtual machine by typing: `vagrant ssh` \n4. cd to the logs folder and run the program by typing: `python logs.py`\n\nNote that the above list is still missing crucial steps. Feel free to use what I wrote, but make sure you also add the missing steps regarding setting up the database.\n\nFor more info on the markdown I used here:\n- [Markdown lists](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists)\n- [Markdown code highlighting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)", "position": 9, "created_at": "2017-05-31T19:25:18.113Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-31T19:27:07.328Z"}, {"category": "nitpick", "content_id": 29126311, "id": 1738401, "user_id": 1456, "body": "To make sure your headers render correctly in a Markdown viewer, be sure to include a space after the '#' mark.
