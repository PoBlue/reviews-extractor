Through interacting with others, we can grow from the input and feedback we receive, and sometimes just plain talking back and forth can really help you understand a topic.", "position": 17, "created_at": "2017-05-17T17:16:47.484Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-17T17:19:22.787Z"}, {"category": "nitpick", "content_id": 26961839, "id": 1676468, "user_id": 4203, "body": "Keeping yourself motivated and on task can be tricky. Some people find things like the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to be helpful. There are different browser extensions/plugins that might help, such as [StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en) for Chrome and [LeechBlock](http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) for Firefox that try to help you avoid distractions.\n\nI personally like using [Habitica](http://habitica.com/), which is like a to-do list game. I always had trouble organizing myself, and I couldn't figure out where to start to fix that. (I would always fail at starting the plan to do so...which means you don't get anywhere.) But even if you aren't really a game person, it's an easy way to put together a bunch of to-do lists, and you can even use it from your phone.\n\nIf you're more of a paper person, you might find a [Bullet Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Ykq55jFdU) or a planner helpful. Bullet Journals can be customized however you like, but a planner has a base build all setup for you.\n\n-----\n\nSomething that can help with the whole looking up process is to save what good sites and pages you find. Then, if you need it again, you don't have to try to hunt it down and remember how you found it before. Some browsers let you attach an account so that you can share your bookmarks across different browsers. There's also bookmarking sites like [Diigo](http://diigo.com/). When you start using Git and GitHub, you could make a repo where you organize your links. And you could always do that with a personal wiki instead.
