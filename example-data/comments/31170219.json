To construct an object with default values.\n2. To initialize an object that doesn't need parameters in that initialization process.\n3. To redefine the scope of the constructor. Making the constructor private will prevent anyone but the class itself from constructing an object.\n \nThe last reason here explains why to set the empty constructor as private.\n \nThere is much to read up on for the topic whether we need one or not.
