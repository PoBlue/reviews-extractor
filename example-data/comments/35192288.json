You can replicate this by typing in \"dog\" or \"test\" for example.  You will get the following error in your logcat:\n\n> org.json.JSONException: No value for authors\n\nWe can check if a JSONObject has a field or not by using the `.has()` method.  We can use that method to make sure we don't try to grab a value that doesn't exist.\n\n    if(volumeInfo.has(\"authors\")){\n        //parse here\n    }\n\nlike that!\n\nAnother option is to use `optJSONArray()` instead of `getJSONArray()`.  This method is used to parse fields that may or may not be present, and won't throw a `JSONException` if it is not present :smile:", "position": 68, "created_at": "2017-07-06T20:22:11.778Z", "updated_at": "2017-07-06T20:22:19.863Z"}]
