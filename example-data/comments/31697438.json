Just HTML5 has over 110 elements, some of which are deprecated and some of which are obsolete. So getting good at researching and finding the best resources is important.\n\nAn easy way to find what you need on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is google. Try something like, \"mdn p tag\" and it most likely show results from mdn first (it always does as far as I know). For deeper knowledge go to the [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) itself. It really isn't as bad as you might think :-).\n\nFor hands-on tools, you could take a look at sites like [http://jsbin.com/](http://jsbin.com/). These types of sites (there are quite a few) let you write code and see the changes in real time.
