nitpick,28661873,1724048,92996,"Did you know that Android provides a resource file in which you can define all the colors you want to use in your app there and then you can reference them throughout your app just by using the name you defined? The main advantage is that you don't need to remember the hex color code, only the name you gave it.
 
Let me make it clear using an example:
 
Say you want to use the black color in some EditText widgets in your app, the hex color code for black is #000000. So, in the colors.xml resource file you can add this entry:
 
```xml
<color name=""edit_text_text_color"">#000000</item>
```
 
Once defined, you could reference it here like this:
 
```xml
android:textColor=""@color/edit_text_text_color""
```
 
Then, if you need to add another TextView and you want its text to be black, you can reference the same `@color/edit_text_text_color`.
 
After a while, you think black is just too boring and you want to change the text colors from your EditTexts to be red, now. In this case, instead of going through each EditText element and change its color, you only need to change the hex color code in the colors.xml resource file to #FF0000:
 
```xml
<color name=""edit_text_text_color"">#FF0000</item>
```
 
Tada... now, all elements in your app that are using `edit_text_text_color` will change its color from black to green.

There are three common reasons to define a default constructor:
 
1. To construct an object with default values.
2. To initialize an object that doesn't need parameters in that initialization process.
3. To redefine the scope of the constructor. Making the constructor private will prevent anyone but the class itself from constructing an object.
 
The last reason here explains why to set the empty constructor as private.

Immutable objects are particularly useful in concurrent applications. Since they cannot change state, they cannot be corrupted by thread interference or observed in an inconsistent state.
Programmers are often reluctant to employ immutable objects, because they worry about the cost of creating a new object as opposed to updating an object in place. The impact of object creation is often overestimated, and can be offset by some of the efficiencies associated with immutable objects. These include decreased overhead due to garbage collection, and the elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption.",7,2017-07-04T04:03:05.505Z,2017-07-04T04:03:05.505Z

## Suggestions:
- 1) **INDENTING**
**Indenting** your code makes it much more readable. This is a very important habit to have because it makes your code much more maintainable.
_________________________

- 2) **MULTIPLE LINES**
When you have a piece of text longer than 79 characters it's considered good practice break this text in multiple lines.  For example:

### Bad:

- 3) **URL**
**URLS** are an exception. Don't split a url over two lines because it makes the urls hard to read, the instead add the comment # NOQA
(The comment # noqa lets you skip error in tools such asPEP 8 online,)

nitpick,28603569,1722444,92996,"Did you know that Android provides a resource file in which you can define all the colors you want to use in your app there and then you can reference them throughout your app just by using the name you defined? The main advantage is that you don't need to remember the hex color code, only the name you gave it.
 
Let me make it clear using an example:
 
Say you want to use the black color in some EditText widgets in your app, the hex color code for black is #000000. So, in the colors.xml resource file you can add this entry:
 
```xml
<color name=""edit_text_text_color"">#000000</item>
```
 
Once defined, you could reference it here like this:
 
```xml
android:textColor=""@color/edit_text_text_color""
```
 
Then, if you need to add another TextView and you want its text to be black, you can reference the same `@color/edit_text_text_color`.
 
After a while, you think black is just too boring and you want to change the text colors from your EditTexts to be red, now. In this case, instead of going through each EditText element and change its color, you only need to change the hex color code in the colors.xml resource file to #FF0000:
 
```xml
<color name=""edit_text_text_color"">#FF0000</item>
```
 
Tada... now, all elements in your app that are using `edit_text_text_color` will change its color from black to green.

You are missing a few steps. You also need to provide instruction on setting up the news database. Provide explicit instructions, with the exact commands needed to create and setup the database. 

You also ask the user to *""cd to the vagrant machine*"". Since you don't mention Vagrant anywhere before this, this could be confusing for the reader. Perhaps in your installation section, you can ensure the user has the proper vagrant environment set up. You could provide a link to the udacity fullstack vagrant repository.

To make your instructions easier to read, I recommend using an ordered list. Use Markdown to style the lists. For example, the following:

```
1. Once all files are downloaded, cd to the vagrant directory that contains the project files.
2.  From the command line, to power up the virtual machine,  run: `vagrant up`. 
3. Log into the virtual machine by typing: `vagrant ssh` 
4. cd to the logs folder and run the program by typing: `python logs.py`
```

The above will render as:

1. Once all files are downloaded, cd to the vagrant directory that contains the project files.
2.  From the command line, to power up the virtual machine,  run: `vagrant up`. 
3. Log into the virtual machine by typing: `vagrant ssh` 
4. cd to the logs folder and run the program by typing: `python logs.py`

Note that the above list is still missing crucial steps. Feel free to use what I wrote, but make sure you also add the missing steps regarding setting up the database.

nitpick,27860439,1701829,7402,"By default, Java makes field variables ""package private"". What this means is any class in the package in which this class resides can access these fields. While this isn't a huge deal for this application, it can make a big difference in more complex applications. This can cause a lot of problems and make things hard to maintain and fix if you are accessing the field from multiple points in the code. Encapsulation(otherwise known as data hiding) is what allows you as a programmer to prevent other classes from directly reaching in and changing the state of your object. There are some times where you want to expose your fields , but unless you're writing a performance heavy application (like a video game), I would recommend always marking them as `private`. Another big exception is if your field is a primitive data type (`int`,` double`, `float`, etc..) and marked `public static final`. Because that variable cannot be changed, and is `static`, it's not that big of a deal to expose it.

Marking your fields as `private` will provide some re-assurance that you haven't changed the variables in some other part of unrelated code resulting in odd behavior and hard to track bugs.

I strongly recommend learning the new version of Javascript - ES6 (ECMAScript 6). It has been officially approved and is widely adopted by programmers. Popular frameworks like Angular 2, React, etc. all prioritize ES6 syntax.

ES6 introduces new syntax/concepts, such as:
- `let` / `const` variables
- Arrow functions, eg:
  ```
  let foo = () => {
    // operations
  };
  ```
- Module import
- `Promise` - a new method to deal with asynchronous task (instead of the old callback function)
- New way to implement Classes, eg:
  ```
  class Foo {
    constructor(num) {
      this.num = num;
    }
    
    addNum(a) {
      return this.num += a;
    }
  }

So here is the corrected result from the SELECT statement on lines 62 - 72:
```
news=> select http_failure.date as failure_date,
news->                   http_success.date as success_date,
news->                   http_success.count as success_count,
news->                   http_failure.count as failure_count,
news->                   (http_success.count + http_failure.count) as total,
news->                   (http_failure.count / (http_success.count +
news(>                   http_failure.count)) as failure_rate
news->                   from http_failure, http_success
news->                   where http_success.date = http_failure.date
news->                   and (http_success.count + http_failure.count) * 0.01 <=

(1 row)
```
This is partially correct - there is only one day, July 17, where the error rate is above 1%.  But note the value returned in the failure_rate column.  PostgreSQL does integer division pretty much the same as how Python does it:
```
news=> select 1265 / (54642 + 1265);
 ?column?
----------
        0
(1 row)
```
So you need to convert some of the values to float; as you would do in Python - the correct value you get from dividing these values is in fact the correct percentage for that day:
```
news=> select 1265.0 / (54642.0 + 1265.0);
        ?column?
------------------------
 0.02262686246802725956

I'll leave it to you as to how/what to convert to float, but here is some info that might help:

nitpick,41215429,2099905,616,"### Head Element and Body Element
The `<head>` element contains information about the webpage and the `<body>` contains everything that is shown inside the main browser.

### Example Structuring
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Title yo</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1> Welcome to my notes yo</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
### Title Element

**`<title>`** element shows the contents at the top of the browser, above the URL.

### Result:
`<title>Title yo</title>`

It is possible to perform data binding on `infowindow` to implement the MVVM pattern for `infowindow`'s content, too (though I'd still prefer the current method of using `InfoWindow.setContent`)

We can actually perform Ajax request using vanilla Javascript code, which is __AWESOME__! :star2: There's no need to use jQuery.

There are very good articles on using Fetch API to implement Ajax request here:

- [Introduction to fetch() @Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch?hl=en)

I strongly recommend learning the new version of Javascript - ES6 (ECMAScript 6). It has been officially approved and is widely adopted by programmers. Popular frameworks like Angular 2, React, etc. all prioritize ES6 syntax.

ES6 introduces new syntax/concepts, such as:
- `let` / `const` variables
- Arrow functions, eg:
  ```
  let foo = () => {
    // operations
  };
  ```
- Module import
- `Promise` - a new method to deal with asynchronous task (instead of the old callback function)
- New way to implement Classes, eg:
  ```
  class Foo {
    constructor(num) {
      this.num = num;
    }
    
    addNum(a) {
      return this.num += a;
    }
  }
  ```
- And many more... :star2:
