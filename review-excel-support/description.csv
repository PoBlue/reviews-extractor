However, it needs some fixes about the Else statement, okay?

I did some observations in the section Code Review to guide you in your next submission.
I hope they can help you.

## Please don't upload build folder

Also, I ask you to please don't upload the folder **build** when submitting again your project, because this folder is not necessary for me testing the app. I just need the source code files. Also, this **build** folder makes the upload too heavy.

## Answer to your question

Do you know if this has happened before to someone else, and what could be the solution? :D

**Answer:** I never heard anything about that. I hope it never happen with you again.

- Always, **always** [clean up your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYvuXY7GRE6VQpq4Rp-KotU1ti-JEySN1KdyKwjhzEQ/pub?embedded=true) and also add some files to gitignore (if you are using Git :octocat:, of course). This way your configurations and private data won't be shared. Read this discussion about it on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16736856/what-should-be-in-my-gitignore-for-an-android-studio-project) and a [great tool](https://www.gitignore.io/)!
- [Inspect your code](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint.html#manuallyRunInspections)! You will find some issues that you can easily fix and make your project better!
- Discover and use new [libraries](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries)!

There are many great additional resources for learning HTML online. Here is a list of a few of the best:

- [MDN's guide to HTML][1].
- [MDN's guide to HTML Elements][2].
- [Udacity's Style Guide for HTML][3].
- [W3 HTML Validator][4].
- [HTML5 specification][5] - which is not a bad place to learn HTML really.

It is especially useful to use the HTML validator, as it checks your HTML and makes sure there are no errors.

Keep up the good work.

Your project was escalated to me because your reviewer is concerned about your progress with the project. 

It looks like you've introduced some new bugs and issues with your latest version of the application:

1) The filter bar overflows the screen and is inaccessible/unusable on mobile:

![filterinvisible.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464137/filterinvisible.png)

2) Additional location details were not provided for *all* locations:

![undefinedrooftop.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464185/undefinedrooftop.png)

In this submission, this was resolved by omitting the 
details from that infowindow altogether. Now it only reads the 
name of the location, which is not the desired behavior:

![empty-rooftop.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464226/empty-rooftop.png)

3) Additionally, in the latest submission, clicking on the list now expands no data. 

I recommend get support from the [discussion forums](https://discussions.udacity.com) or by scheduling a [1:1 consultation](https://calendly.com/fend-1-1) with a mentor to get help with these challenges.
