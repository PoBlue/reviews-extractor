Also, I ask you to please don't upload the folder **build** when submitting again your project, because this folder is not necessary for me testing the app. I just need the source code files. Also, this **build** folder makes the upload too heavy.

## Answer to your question

Do you know if this has happened before to someone else, and what could be the solution? :D

- Always, **always** [clean up your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYvuXY7GRE6VQpq4Rp-KotU1ti-JEySN1KdyKwjhzEQ/pub?embedded=true) and also add some files to gitignore (if you are using Git :octocat:, of course). This way your configurations and private data won't be shared. Read this discussion about it on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16736856/what-should-be-in-my-gitignore-for-an-android-studio-project) and a [great tool](https://www.gitignore.io/)!
- [Inspect your code](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint.html#manuallyRunInspections)! You will find some issues that you can easily fix and make your project better!
- Discover and use new [libraries](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries)!

**Response:** Don't worry about it.

This also depends on the date you joined the course. Even if you joined the first cohort (March 22), there is still around 2. 5 months remaining (though the term has already ended is currently a week into the term extension), which should be enough to complete all projects if you set your mind to it.

- [MDN's guide to HTML][1].
- [MDN's guide to HTML Elements][2].
- [Udacity's Style Guide for HTML][3].
- [W3 HTML Validator][4].
- [HTML5 specification][5] - which is not a bad place to learn HTML really.

It is especially useful to use the HTML validator, as it checks your HTML and makes sure there are no errors.

I also asked Udacity to pass along my message (which may or may not get to you later on).

First of all, thanks for reaching out. I know how frustrating this can be--really!

Second, Yes, we do see the prior reviews, and in this case I thoroughly reviewed them and considered them. I also considered your message referencing the Bible search (for books without authors I assume) and if you carefully read my review, you will see that none of the issues flagged are time consuming! And they are important for your understanding and for creating the best app possible, which you clearly want! 

I spent a long time reviewing all the lines of code in your app to understand what you did and planned to do. The notes include some sample code for you to implement. One change will take less than a minute to get done. This is a chance for a number of reviewers to weigh in when it does not pass and an opportunity for you to learn from feedback from a variety of reviewers. That is a positive and not something to complain about.

So to summarize: There are three remaining issues with the Book List app, and the good news is that they do not take much time:


1. Removing all unused methods, variables, etc., all part of Formatting. This is a good way for you to understand your code better, because using lots of variables, strings, methods that are not really used will lead to not knowing what is going on in the app. This happens when we use other bits of code to piece an app together without full understanding. Doing this cleanup is very helpful to see her working code (by removing what is not doing anything). This should just take a few minutes per file, and should have been done prior to submitting it.
2.  The second item that needs to be fixed is a more complete message in case no books are found. This takes less than a minute to fix, just adding a few words to the string of that error message. This was part of the rubric before, just not noticed or addressed.
3.  The final thing was not correct before (JSON parsing) and clearly something that you thought you had fixed. You left a message about doing the ""Bible"" search (which I understand to mean a search for books without authors) and that it was all working. However, you have not coded for books without authors, and there are many! That is why  I gave you a code snippet to implement, which will take a few minutes to consider, think about and implement. Your app will be a lot better after you have that code in there.

I know we want to move through the course and you are perhaps a little disappointed because you were hoping you were done, but we would not be doing our job if we did not show you how it can be better! Every reviewer is a bit different, places emphasis on different issues, and we all can overlook something, but once you make the changes, you will have a great app you can be proud of!

Best of luck!",2017-05-19T06:57:32.646Z,2017-05-19T09:54:32.717Z

Putting the the dimensions inside the `dimens.xml` resource file will make them easier to manage and categorize. The `styles.xml` file can have many other resources, not just dimensions.

Your project was escalated to me because your reviewer is concerned about your progress with the project. 

It looks like you've introduced some new bugs and issues with your latest version of the application:

1) The filter bar overflows the screen and is inaccessible/unusable on mobile:

![filterinvisible.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464137/filterinvisible.png)

![undefinedrooftop.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464185/undefinedrooftop.png)

In this submission, this was resolved by omitting the 
details from that infowindow altogether. Now it only reads the 
name of the location, which is not the desired behavior:

![empty-rooftop.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/_attachments/1079/1499464226/empty-rooftop.png)

3) Additionally, in the latest submission, clicking on the list now expands no data. 

I recommend get support from the [discussion forums](https://discussions.udacity.com) or by scheduling a [1:1 consultation](https://calendly.com/fend-1-1) with a mentor to get help with these challenges.

Your understanding and clarity of concepts of how GANs work is vividly depicted here. You've done a great job of implementing a Deep Convolutional GAN.  

You've almost done the hard part of building the neural network, all it now needs is some subtle corrections (running the code after normalising the input image of D to the same range as the outputs of G) and some more hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning can sometimes be a very daunting task, but I have put forward my tips and suggestions which will help you in tuning up your GAN in no time at all and will get you pass this project with your next submission.

Moreover, even you will be amazed by the results that shall be produced!
